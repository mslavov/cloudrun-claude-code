# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

This is a Cloud Run service that wraps the Claude Code TypeScript SDK to provide a production-ready deployment with dynamic configuration for MCP servers, system prompts, and tool permissions. The service runs Claude Code CLI in ephemeral containers with per-request isolation.

## Documentation Guides

This repository includes comprehensive documentation:
- **README.md**: Project overview, features, quick start, and API usage examples
- **docs/deployment.md**: Detailed step-by-step deployment guide with all necessary commands
- **docs/testing.md**: Complete testing guide with local and remote testing instructions
- **docs/index.md**: Documentation index with links to all guides

When working on deployment or testing tasks, read the appropriate guide first for complete instructions and commands.

## Key Commands

### Development
```bash
npm run dev       # Start development server with hot reload (uses tsx watch)
npm run build     # Compile TypeScript to JavaScript in dist/
npm start         # Run production server from dist/
```

### Testing
**IMPORTANT**: Always use/update the existing test script at `scripts/test.sh` when testing changes.

```bash
./scripts/test.sh local    # Test local Docker container
./scripts/test.sh remote   # Test deployed Cloud Run service
./scripts/test.sh auth     # Test authentication setup
./scripts/test.sh examples # Show API request examples
./scripts/test.sh all      # Run all tests
```

For deployment and service account setup commands, refer to docs/deployment.md and docs/testing.md.

## Architecture

### Core Components
- **src/server.ts**: Express server handling /run endpoint, SSE streaming, request validation
- **src/claude-runner.ts**: Manages Claude CLI subprocess spawning with two execution modes (named pipe or direct stdin)
- **Dockerfile**: Multi-stage build installing Claude Code via official script, runs as non-root user

### Request Flow
1. Client sends POST to /run with prompt and configuration
2. Server creates ephemeral workspace in /tmp
3. ClaudeRunner spawns claude CLI subprocess with arguments
4. Output streams back to client via Server-Sent Events (SSE)
5. Workspace cleaned up after request completion

### Key Design Decisions
- **Ephemeral Workspaces**: Each request gets isolated /tmp/ws-{requestId} directory
- **Two Execution Modes**: Named pipe method (better for large prompts) or direct stdin
- **Global Claude Installation**: Claude Code installed globally in Docker following official pattern
- **Dynamic Configuration**: MCP servers, system prompts, tools configured per-request
- **Authentication**: Supports both API keys and OAuth tokens

## Authentication Methods
- **ANTHROPIC_API_KEY**: Direct API access from console.anthropic.com
- **CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN**: OAuth token from Claude subscription using `claude setup-token`

## Configuration Options

### Request Parameters
- `prompt` (required): The prompt for Claude
- `systemPrompt`: Custom system prompt to replace default
- `appendSystemPrompt`: Text to append to system prompt
- `allowedTools`: List of allowed tools
- `disallowedTools`: List of tools to block
- `permissionMode`: Permission mode (acceptEdits, bypassPermissions, plan)
- `mcpConfigJson`: MCP server configuration object
- `maxTurns`: Maximum conversation turns (default: 6)
- `model`: Specific Claude model to use
- `fallbackModel`: Fallback model if primary fails
- `useNamedPipe`: Use named pipe for prompt delivery (default: true)
- `gitRepo`: Git repository URL to clone (SSH or HTTPS)
- `gitBranch`: Git branch to checkout (default: main)
- `gitDepth`: Clone depth for shallow cloning (default: 1)
- `environmentSecrets`: Object with environment variables as key-value pairs
- `sshKey`: SSH private key for git authentication (PEM format)
- `timeoutMinutes`: Process timeout in minutes (default: 55, max: 60)
- `metadata`: Optional metadata for logging/tracking

### Environment Variables
- `PORT`: Server port (default: 8080)
- `ALLOWED_TOOLS`: Default allowed tools list
- `PERMISSION_MODE`: Default permission mode

## Important Implementation Details

### Concurrency Settings
- **CONCURRENCY=3**: Optimal for Claude workloads (1.3GB RAM, 0.66 CPU per request)
- Lower concurrency ensures adequate resources for AI code generation tasks
- Total capacity: 30 concurrent requests (10 instances Ã— 3 each)

### Claude CLI Environment Setup (claude-runner.ts)
- Sets `CLAUDE_CODE_ACTION=1` to enable OAuth support
- Preserves HOME directory for Claude configuration access
- Passes through CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN if available
- Configures timeout (default 55 minutes)

### Server Security (server.ts)
- Request size limit: 2MB
- Ephemeral workspace cleanup after 5 seconds
- Client disconnect handling kills Claude process
- Health check endpoints for monitoring

### Docker Configuration
- Claude Code installed via official install script
- Non-root user (appuser) with proper permissions
- Claude installation moved to /opt for shared access
- Symlinks created for user home directory access

## SSH Key and Environment Variable Management

The service uses a **payload-based approach** for SSH keys and environment variables, designed to work seamlessly with orchestration systems like Agent Forge.

### Payload-Based (Recommended)
SSH keys and environment variables are passed directly in the `/run` request payload:

```json
{
  "prompt": "Run tests and deploy",
  "gitRepo": "git@github.com:myorg/myrepo.git",
  "gitBranch": "main",
  "sshKey": "-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----",
  "environmentSecrets": {
    "DATABASE_URL": "postgres://...",
    "API_KEY": "sk-..."
  }
}
```

**How it works:**
- SSH keys are written to the ephemeral workspace with secure permissions (0600)
- HTTPS URLs are automatically converted to SSH format if an SSH key is provided
- Environment variables are injected into Claude's process and written to `.env` file
- All credentials are cleaned up automatically after request completion
- Each request has isolated credentials, preventing cross-contamination

**Benefits:**
- Dynamic per-request credentials from orchestration system
- No long-term storage of sensitive data in the service
- Better security isolation between repositories
- Flexible credential management controlled by the caller

### Global SSH Key (Fallback, Optional)
For backward compatibility, a global SSH key can be mounted at `/home/appuser/.ssh/id_rsa` via Secret Manager:
- Set via `GIT_SSH_KEY` environment variable during deployment
- Used only when no `sshKey` is provided in the payload
- Configured during deployment via `scripts/gen_key.sh` and `scripts/create-secrets.sh`

The service automatically detects which approach to use:
- If `sshKey` is provided in payload, uses that (recommended)
- Otherwise, falls back to the global SSH key if mounted
- If neither is available, assumes public repository access

## Common Issues

### OAuth Token Setup
OAuth tokens from Claude subscriptions work with this service. The service sets `CLAUDE_CODE_ACTION=1` for proper OAuth support in the containerized environment.

### Process Timeouts
Claude processes have a configurable timeout (default 55 minutes, max 60 minutes per Cloud Run limits). Long-running tasks may need timeout adjustment via `timeoutMinutes` option.

### Named Pipe vs Direct Input
The service supports two prompt delivery methods:
- Named pipe (default): Better for large prompts, uses mkfifo
- Direct stdin: Simpler but may have issues with very large prompts
